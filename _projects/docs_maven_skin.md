A minimalist and responsive Bootstrap-based HTML5 skin for Maven Site, which will help to create documentation sites with Maven.

It is easy to use, just remember to check the project documentation to find out how to set it up, and also to find out how the skin looks in an actual Maven Site. New projects may as well make use of the Library Maven Archetype which, among other features, takes advantage of this skin and shows how to set it up.

The skin has been adapted from the static template Docs Bootstrap Template, which will be the visual reference to be followed by this project.
