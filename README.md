# Front Site

A small site to have as the front site for my domain.

It is created with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), which generates a static site from the project files.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Jekyll
- Ruby

### Building

The project can be generated locally:

```
$ jekyll build
```

But as the resource links probably won't work this is only useful for manual deployment

### Local Deployment

To actually test the site it should be published locally:

```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Now it can be checked at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000);

## Collaborate

Any kind of help with the project will be well received, and there are two main ways to give such help:

- Reporting errors and asking for extensions through the issues management
- or forking the repository and extending the project

### Issues Management

Issues are managed at the GitHub [project issues tracker][issues], where any Github user may report bugs or ask for new features.

### Getting the Code

If you wish to fork or modify the code, visit the [GitHub project page][scm], where the latest versions are always kept. Check the 'master' branch for the latest release, and the 'develop' for the current, and stable, development version.

The project has been released under the [MIT License][license].
